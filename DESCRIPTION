Description: Provides tools for analyzing spatial cell-cell interactions based on ligand-receptor pairs, including functions for local, regional, and global analysis using spatial transcriptomics data. Integrates with databases like CellChat, CellPhoneDB, Cellinker, ICELLNET, and ConnectomeDB to identify ligand-receptor pairs, visualize interactions through heat maps, chord diagrams, and infer interactions on different spatial scales.
